Inheritance: Python projet
==========================

In this project we will discuss the notion of inheritance in python and understand its purpose. We will know what is called superclass, parent class and subclass and how to use them. In addition we will learn how to inherit from one class to another, list all the attributes and methods of a class or an instance, replace a method or an attribute inherited from the base and other exciting stuff. Are you ready we take off in...
